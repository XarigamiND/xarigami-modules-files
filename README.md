# Xarigami Files Module

The Files module emulates the file managers commonly seen in
web hosting administrative interfaces such as cPanel. Its intent 
is for file swapping among project committees and executive boards 
whose members are no tech-savvy or for which FTP is otherwise
too complicated to use.
