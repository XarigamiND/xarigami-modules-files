Mime images
--------------

Background:

This module uses mimetype images from the mime module.  However, the mime
module does not make thumbnails suitable for file listings in this module.
Therefore, the standard images from the mime module have been resized and
included in the mime/ directory.  Copy the contrib/mime/ folder to
/themes/your-theme/modules/ or copy the images from the mime/images/
folder to /modules/mime/xarimages/.

A shell script for resizing images has also been included.  See
contrib/resize-images.sh.  This requires ImageMagick's convert utility.


Summary (in *nix-speak):

cp -a contrib/mime/ /path/to/your/site/themes/your-theme/modules/

 ** or **

cp -a contrib/mime/images/* /path/to/your/site/modules/mime/xarimages/
